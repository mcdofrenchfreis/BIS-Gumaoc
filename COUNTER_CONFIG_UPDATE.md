# Counter Configuration Update Summary

## Changes Made

### Database Updates
Updated `queue_counters` table to assign the correct services:

1. **Counter 1 - All Certificates**
   - Updated counter name: "Counter 1 - All Certificates"
   - Primary service ID: 1 (Barangay Clearance)
   - **Special functionality**: Can handle ALL certificate types (Service IDs 1, 2, 3, 4)

2. **Counter 2 - Business Applications**
   - Updated counter name: "Counter 2 - Business Applications" 
   - Service ID: 6 (Business Permit)
   - Handles all business permit applications and renewals

### QueueManager Enhancements

Modified `c:/xampp/htdocs/GUMAOC/includes/QueueManager.php` with the following changes:

#### Enhanced `callNextTicket()` Method
- **Counter 1 Special Logic**: When Counter 1 calls next ticket, it searches for ANY certificate-related tickets (service IDs 1, 2, 3, 4)
- **Other Counters**: Continue to work with their specific assigned service
- **General Services Fallback**: Counter 3 (General Services) can still handle any remaining tickets

#### Service Mapping
The system already correctly maps certificate types to service IDs:
- Service ID 1: Barangay Clearance (`BRGY. CLEARANCE`)
- Service ID 2: Barangay Indigency (`BRGY. INDIGENCY`)  
- Service ID 3: Tricycle Permit (`TRICYCLE PERMIT`)
- Service ID 4: Proof of Residency (`PROOF OF RESIDENCY`)
- Service ID 5: General Services (for CEDULA/CTC and other certificates)
- Service ID 6: Business Permit (`BUSINESS APPLICATION`)

## How It Works

### Certificate Processing Flow
1. User submits any certificate request through the certificate-request.php form
2. System automatically generates appropriate queue ticket with correct service ID
3. **Counter 1** can now call and serve ANY certificate type (IDs 1-4)
4. **Counter 2** specifically handles business applications (ID 6)
5. **Counter 3** (General Services) serves as fallback for any remaining tickets

### Priority Handling
Counter 1 will prioritize tickets in this order:
1. Urgent priority certificates
2. Senior/PWD/Pregnant priority certificates  
3. Regular certificates by order of submission (queue_position ASC)

### Debugging Enhancement
Updated error messages to clearly indicate:
- Counter 1 can handle certificate services (IDs: 1,2,3,4)
- Other counters show their specific service assignments
- Detailed information about available tickets and service IDs

## Benefits

1. **Improved Efficiency**: Counter 1 can handle the full range of certificates instead of just barangay clearances
2. **Specialized Service**: Counter 2 is dedicated to business applications for faster processing
3. **Flexibility**: System maintains fallback options through General Services counter
4. **Better Queue Management**: Reduces bottlenecks by allowing multiple certificate types at Counter 1
5. **Clear Organization**: Business applications have their dedicated counter for specialized handling

## Testing Recommendations

1. Generate test tickets for different certificate types
2. Verify Counter 1 can call any certificate ticket (service IDs 1-4)
3. Confirm Counter 2 only handles business permits (service ID 6)
4. Test the fallback mechanism with General Services counter
5. Verify queue displays show correct counter assignments

The system is now configured as requested with Counter 1 handling all certificates and Counter 2 handling business applications.
